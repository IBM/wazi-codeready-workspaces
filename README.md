### Customizing the Registry Images
IBM Wazi Developer for Workspaces allows for additional custom devfile stack(s) and plugins for a tailored development environment. After the registry images are rebuilt and pushed into a container registry, then these images can be specified when creating an instance of IBM Wazi Developer for Workspaces or to patch an existing instance.

#### Custom Devfile Registry Image

**Working Directory:** ./dependencies/che-devfile-registry

1. Add a custom devfile stack into the [devfiles](dependencies/che-devfile-registry/devfiles) folder. See the [Wazi Developer](dependencies/che-devfile-registry/devfiles/01_wazi-developer) stack for an example and [Devfile specifications](https://devfile.io/docs).
1. Add an image into the [images folder](dependencies/che-devfile-registry/images).
1. Build the devfile registry image and push the image into a container registry accessible by the OpenShift cluster.

```
docker build -t <registry>/<namespace>/<devfile_image_name>:<tag> -f build/dockerfiles/Dockerfile --target "registry" .
docker push <registry>/<namespace>/<devfile_image_name>:<tag>
```

#### Custom Plugin Registry Image

**Working Directory:** ./dependencies/che-plugin-registry

1. Add a custom plugin into the [plugins](dependencies/che-plugin-registry/v3/plugins) folder. See the [Wazi Developer](dependencies/che-plugin-registry/v3/plugins/ibm) plugins for an example.
1. Add an image into the [images folder](dependencies/che-plugin-registry/v3/images).
1. Update the [index.json](dependencies/che-plugin-registry/v3/plugins/index.json) file with an entry for the custom plugin.
1. Download the Wazi Developer extensions per the table specifications below.
1. Build the plugin registry image and push the image into a container registry accessible by the OpenShift cluster.

```
docker build -t <registry>/<namespace>/<plugin_image_name>:<tag> -f build/dockerfiles/Dockerfile --target "registry" .
docker push <registry>/<namespace>/<plugin_image_name>:<tag>
```

**_Red Hat Content_**  
 
Links marked with this icon :door: are _internal to Red Hat_. This includes Jenkins servers, job configs in gitlab, and container sources in dist-git. 

Because these services are internal, in the interest of making all things open, we've copied as much as possible into the [codeready-workspaces-images](https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images) repo.

# What's inside?

**NOTE:** the so-called master branch is deprecated and is no longer kept up to date. Instead, the latest nightly sources are in **crw-2-rhel-8 branch**, synced to upstream projects' main (or master) branches.

For the latest stable release, see the **crw-2.y-rhel-8** branch with the largest y value.

---

This repository no longer hosts the CodeReady Workspaces Server assembly that mainly inherits Eclipse Che artifacts and repackages some of them. Server has moved to [codeready-workspaces-images/codeready-workspaces](https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/blob/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces/README.adoc#how-to-build-locally).

## How to Build

See this document for how to use those build systems, in order to publish a container image to Red Hat Container Catalog:

* https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-productization/blob/master/devdoc/building/osbs-container-builds.adoc

See also:

* https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/CRW_CI/ (crw-server_*) :door:
* https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images#jenkins-jobs

### Keeping CRW dependencies in sync with upstream and downstream

Folders under [/dependencies](dependencies) are synced to https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images. If no matching project exists under the [/dependencies](dependencies) folder, sync occurs directly from an upstream Che project.

The sync logic is in one of three places:

* a Jenkins job - eg., [crw-theia-sources_2.x.jenkinsfile](https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/blob/crw-2-rhel-8/crw-jenkins/jobs/CRW_CI/crw-theia-sources_2.x.jenkinsfile), 
* a get-sources-jenkins.sh script - eg., [plugin-java8 get-sources-jenkins.sh](https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/blob/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces-plugin-java8/get-sources-jenkins.sh), or
* a sync-*.sh script - eg., [devworkspace controller build/scripts/sync.sh](https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/blob/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces-devworkspace-controller/build/scripts/sync.sh). 

**NOTE:** over time we're trying to move all sync logic out of Jenkinsfiles and into scripts that can be run locally, so during outages build process can still be orchestrated. Goal is to have Jenkins simply call sync.sh scripts to perform syncs, and get-sources.sh scripts to collect assets from Jenkins (or other places) in order to commit those source tarballs + trigger Brew builds.

Sync jobs:

* https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/CRW_CI/ (jobs) :door:
* https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/crw-jenkins/-/tree/master/jobs/CRW_CI (sources) :door:
* https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images#jenkins-jobs (copied sources)
